Work in progress

Todo list
----------

- Choose a license
- Get debuggee control working on x86 and x64 linux (that includes reading registers, text segment, and setting breakpoints on addresses)
- Use dwarf debug symbols to enable setting breakpoints on source code lines
- Use dwarf debug symbols to read variables in code
- Look into supporting Windows and MacOS
- Look into supporting expressions
- Look into providing a C api
